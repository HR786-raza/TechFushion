    title: "Why Web3 Matters",
    content: `
      <img src="Images/web3.jpg" alt="Web3" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <p><strong>Web3</strong> represents the next phase of the internet—decentralized, user-centric, and powered by blockchain. Unlike Web2, which relies heavily on centralized platforms like Facebook or Google, Web3 enables users to interact peer-to-peer without intermediaries.</p>
      <p>Key technologies driving Web3 include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blockchain</strong> - Distributed ledgers securing digital ownership</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contracts</strong> - Self-executing agreements on-chain</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Apps (DApps)</strong> - Apps without central servers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Benefits of Web3:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ownership of digital assets</li>
        <li>Improved privacy and data control</li>
        <li>Open-source and censorship-resistant applications</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although Web3 is still in its early stages, it holds the potential to transform industries from finance to social media by removing central authorities and putting users in control.</p>

    title: "Top JavaScript Frameworks",
    content: `
      <img src="Images/javascript.jpg" alt="JavaScript Frameworks" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <p>JavaScript frameworks streamline the process of building robust front-end applications. Here's a comparison of three top frameworks:</p>

      <h4>React</h4>
      <p>Developed by Facebook, React is a UI library that emphasizes reusable components and a virtual DOM for performance. Ideal for dynamic, data-heavy apps.</p>

      <h4>Vue</h4>
      <p>Vue is a lightweight, progressive framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. It combines the best of Angular and React while being beginner-friendly.</p>

      <h4>Angular</h4>
      <p>Maintained by Google, Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework offering two-way data binding, dependency injection, and extensive tooling for enterprise-grade apps.</p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Choose React for flexibility and ecosystem, Vue for simplicity, and Angular for all-in-one enterprise needs.</p>

    content: `
      <img src="Images/AI.jpg" alt="AI 2025" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword—it's a reality that is reshaping industries, economies, and our everyday lives. By 2025, AI will be more embedded into society than ever before, powering innovation from healthcare to entertainment.</p>

      <h4>Smarter Healthcare</h4>
      <p>AI will assist doctors in diagnosing diseases faster and more accurately. Personalized medicine will use machine learning to tailor treatments to individual genetics and lifestyle factors.</p>

      <h4>Autonomous Systems</h4>
      <p>From self-driving cars to autonomous drones, AI will revolutionize transport and logistics. Expect real-time traffic navigation, safer roadways, and automated deliveries becoming standard in urban environments.</p>

      <h4>AI in Daily Applications</h4>
      <p>Smart assistants, recommendation engines, and automated content creation will be more nuanced and context-aware, providing hyper-personalized experiences to users.</p>

      <h4>AI & Creativity</h4>
      <p>Generative AI models like GPT and DALL·E will evolve further to assist in writing, music composition, game design, and even filmmaking, democratizing creativity.</p>

      <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
      <p>Alongside these advancements, governments and organizations will focus on regulation. Key areas will include data privacy, algorithmic transparency, deepfake prevention, and fairness in AI decision-making systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The AI landscape in 2025 promises to bring transformative changes. The real challenge will be to balance innovation with responsibility, ensuring AI benefits all of humanity.</p>
